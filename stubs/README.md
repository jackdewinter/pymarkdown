# Stubs Folder

This folder is where additional stubs are provided for MyPy.  These are required
in cases where the Python Package does not provide typing libraries for its own
package.

These stubs can be generated by executing a command line similar to the following:

```bash
pipenv run stubgen --output stubs -p {package-name}
```

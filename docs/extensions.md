# Implemented Extensions

These are the extensions that are currently implemented.

- [Pragmas](/docs/extensions/pragmas.md)
- [Document Front-Matter](/docs/extensions/front-matter.md)
- [Markdown - Disallowed Raw HTML](/docs/extensions/disallowed-raw_html.md)
- [Markdown - Extended Autolinks](/docs/extensions/extended_autolinks.md)
- [Markdown - Strikethrough](/docs/extensions/strikethrough.md)
- [Markdown - Task List Items](/docs/extensions/task-list-items.md)

Note that the Tables extension is currently slated to be added after
the initial 1.0 release.  That delay is mostly due to the large amounts
of testing involved inensuring that the table elements interact properly
with the other Markdown elements.

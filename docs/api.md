            property_value (int): Integer value to set the property to.

        Raises:
            PyMarkdownApiArgumentException: If `property_name` is empty or if
            `property_value` is not an `int` value.

        Returns:
            An instance of `PyMarkdownApi` to allow for function chaining.

        Examples:
            This function sets a integer value for a specific configuration item.

                from pymarkdown.api import PyMarkdownApi

                PyMarkdownApi().set_integer_property("plugins.md007.code_block_line_length", 160).scan_path("file.md")

    `set_property(self, property_name: str, property_value: Any) ‑> api.PyMarkdownApi`
    :   Set a named configuration property to a given value.  Whatever is passed in as
        the property_value parameter is translated into a string.

        If at all possible, the other three `set_x_property` functions should be used
        as they ensure that the correct type of value is set as the configuration item
        value.  This function translated ANY value for the `property_value` argument
        into a `str` before setting it as the configuration item value.

        Args:
            property_name (str): Full hierarchical name of the property to set.
            property_value (Any): Value to set the property to after applying a string
                transformation to the value.

        Raises:
            PyMarkdownApiArgumentException: If `property_name` is empty.

        Returns:
            An instance of `PyMarkdownApi` to allow for function chaining.

        Examples:
            This function sets a value, translated into a string, for a specific configuration item.

                from pymarkdown.api import PyMarkdownApi

                PyMarkdownApi().set_property("plugins.heading-style-h1.style", 1).scan_path("file.md")

    `set_string_property(self, property_name: str, property_value: str) ‑> api.PyMarkdownApi`
    :   Set a named configuration property to a given string value.

        Args:
            property_name (str): Full hierarchical name of the property to set.
            property_value (str): String value to set the property to.

        Raises:
            PyMarkdownApiArgumentException: If `property_name` is empty or if
            `property_value` is not an `str` value.

        Returns:
            An instance of `PyMarkdownApi` to allow for function chaining.

        Examples:
            This function sets a string value for a specific configuration item.

                from pymarkdown.api import PyMarkdownApi

                PyMarkdownApi().set_string_property("plugins.heading-style-h1.style", "consistent").scan_path("file.md")

`PyMarkdownApiArgumentException(argument_name: str, reason: str)`
:   Class to provide for an argument that an exception is not valid.

    This exception is raised when an argument to a function falls outside of the
    expected behavior for that function.  This can mean that a `str` parameter
    is unexpectedly empty or that the parameter is not one of the allowed values
    for that parameter.

    Attributes:
        reason (str): Reported reason why the action failed.
        argument_name(str): Name of the argument that caused this exception to be raised.

    * builtins.Exception
    * builtins.BaseException

    ### Instance variables

    `argument_name: str`
    :   Name of the argument that caused this exception to be raised.

`PyMarkdownApiException(reason: str)`
:   Class to provide for an exception that is thrown by the API layer.

    This base PyMarkdown application exception is explicitly thrown when a unexpected error occurs that
    is not categorized as one of the other application exceptions.  Where possible, child classes of
    this class should be used to provide more specific information regarding the nature of the
    exception.

    Attributes:
        reason (str): Reported reason why the action failed.

    ### Ancestors (in MRO)

    * builtins.Exception
    * builtins.BaseException

    ### Descendants

    * api.PyMarkdownApiArgumentException

    * api.PyMarkdownApiNotSupportedException

    ### Instance variables

    `reason: str`
    :   Reported reason why the action failed.

`PyMarkdownApiNoFilesFoundException(reason: str)`
:   Class to provide for an exception that the invoked API was not able to find at least one file to process.

    This is raised as an exception if at least one file to scan or fix is
    not encountered.  As the PyMarkdown application is a scanning application,
    not finding a single Markdown document to scan is typically an exceptional
    case.

    Attributes:
        reason (str): Reported reason why the action failed.

    ### Ancestors (in MRO)

    * api.PyMarkdownApiException
    * builtins.Exception
    * builtins.BaseException

`PyMarkdownApiNotSupportedException(reason: str)`
:   Class to provide for an exception that a given situation is not supported.

    The most frequent raising of this exception is when the `PyMarkdownApi` instance
    is created with the *inherit_logging* set to `True`, followed by a call to
    one of the functions that alters the logging behavior of the application.

    Attributes:
        reason (str): Reported reason why the action failed.

`PyMarkdownFixResult(files_fixed: List[str])`
:   Result for the fix_path function.

    The only information that PyMarkdown provides about scanned and fixed
    documents are the names of the documents that were fixed.  As such, this result
    simple provides those same Markdown file names.

    Attributes:
        files_fixed (List[str]): List of zero or more files that were fixed.

    ### Class variables

    `files_fixed: List[str]`
    :   List of zero or more files that were fixed.

`PyMarkdownFixStringResult(was_fixed: bool, fixed_file: str)`
:   Result for the fix_string function.

    Focusing on a singular Markdown document, this object returns an indication
    of whether fixes were applied along with the fixed document.

    Attributes:
        was_fixed (bool): Whether the string, interpretted as a Markdown document, was fixed.
        fixed_file (str): String that was passed into the `fix_string` function, with any fixes applied to it.

    ### Class variables

    :   String that was passed into the `fix_string` function, with any fixes applied
        to it.

    `was_fixed: bool`
    :   Whether the string was fixed.

`PyMarkdownListPathResult(matching_files: List[str])`
:   Result for the list_path function.

    This object returns a list of files that PyMarkdown understands to be eligible
    for scanning, without having scanned those files.

    Attributes:
        matching_files (List[str]): List of filenames that match the specifications of the requested path.

    ### Class variables

    `matching_files: List[str]`

`PyMarkdownPragmaError(file_path: str, line_number: int, pragma_error: str)`
:   Class to encapsulate the information for a pragma error.

    Each instance of this class specifies a single pragma failure that was encountered
    within the specified Markdown document.  Using the encapsulated fields, the following
    pieces of information about that pragma error can be determined:

    - the location where the pragma error occurred
    - the specific location within that location that triggered the pragma error
    - specific information on why PyMarkdown generated the pragma error

    More information on Pragmas and
    their use are available [here](./user-guide.md#pragma-extension).

    Attributes:
        file_path (str): Path to the file that contains the improperly constructed pragma.
        line_number (int): Line number where the pragma is contained.
        pragma_error (str): Specific information about the error.

    ### Class variables

    `file_path: str`
    :   Path to the file that contains the improperly constructed pragma.

    `line_number: int`
    :   Line number where the pragma is contained.

    `pragma_error: str`
    :   Specific information about the error.

`PyMarkdownScanFailure(scan_file: str, line_number: int, column_number: int, rule_id: str, rule_name: str, rule_description: str, extra_error_information: Optional[str])`
:   Class to contain information about a failure reported by one of the rule plugins.

    Each instance of this class specifies a single scan failure that was encountered
    within the specified Markdown document.  Using the encapsulated fields, the following
    pieces of information about that scan failure can be determined:

    - the location where the scan failure occurred
    - the specific location within that location that triggered the scan failure
    - the exact rule that was triggered

    Optionally, depending on the rule, extra information may be present in the
    `extra_error_information` field.  This information is rule-dependent and is
    intended to provide extra clarity on why the rule was triggered.

    For more information consult the [Rule Failure Format](../user-guide.md#rule-failure-format)
    section of our User's Guide.

    Attributes:
        scan_file (str): Path to the file containing the failure.
        line_number (int): Line number of the triggered rule failure.
        column_number (int): Column number of the triggered rule failure.
        rule_id (str): ID of the rule that was triggered.
        rule_name (str): Name(s) of the rule that was triggered.
        rule_description (str) Longer description of the rule that was triggered.
        extra_error_information (Optional[str]): String providing more information on why the rule was triggered.

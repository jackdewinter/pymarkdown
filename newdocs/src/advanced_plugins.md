# Advanced Rules

This document is the home of information regarding how to use the Rule Plugins that
are released with the PyMarkdown application.

Things that will be added:

- ensure solid documentation on each extensions
- ensure each extension has good examples
- [listing](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/advanced_plugins.md)
- enabling/disabling for entire scan
- disabling inline using pragmas
- [rules](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/rules.md)
- [Pragmas to Disable Rules Inline](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/advanced_scanning.md#pragmas)

Note that the initial set of rules are modelled after the 42 rules provided by
David Anson's [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)
project. This decision was made to give Markdown authors that use his project in
their IDEs (such as the MarkdownLint plugin for VSCode that I use), a good
grounding in what they can consistently check for.

- move references in the main documentation from /docs into /newdocs

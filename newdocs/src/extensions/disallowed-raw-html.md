## Summary

This extension follows the GitHub Flavored Markdown
[rules](https://github.github.com/gfm/#disallowed-raw-html-extension-) for the
marking of certain HTML tag names as disallowed.  Once marked as disallowed, the
HTML tag will have the leading character `<` changed to `&lt;` to prevent it from
being rendered as a HTML tag by browsers.

## Examples

With this extension enabled and default configuration, the following Markdown text:

```Markdown
<script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
```

produces the following html:

```HTML
&lt;script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
```

which renders as:

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-inline-html-->
&lt;script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>

## Specifics

As noted on the GitHub Flavored Markdown page:

> These tags are chosen in particular as they change how HTML is interpreted
> in a way unique to them (i.e. nested HTML is interpreted differently), and
> this is usually undesirable in the context of other rendered Markdown content.

Basically, if you allow those tags to occur within documents, they will affect
any tags within their hierarchy, whether generated by the Markdown transformer
or placed within the document as explicit HTML.

Therefore, this extension provides for the ability to prevent a set of HTML
tags from appearing in generated documents as proper HTML.  The initial
set of these (case insensitive) tag names is:

- title
- textarea
- style
- xmp
- iframe
- noembed
- noframes
- script
- plaintext

## Configuring Tags to Disallow

This set of tag names can be modified by using the `change_tag_names` configuration
property for the extension.  This property takes a comma-separated list of tag names
with each tag name starting with a `-` character or a `+` character.  For example,
to modify the list to remove the `style` tag name and to add the `something` tag
name, the `extensions.markdown-disallow-raw-html.change_tag_names` configuration
value would be set to: `-style,+something`.

```json
{
    "extensions" : {
        "markdown-disallow-raw-html" : {
            "change_tag_names": "-style,+something"
        }
    }
}
```

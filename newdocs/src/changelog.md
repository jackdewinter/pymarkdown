## Version 0.9.21 - Date: 2024-07-01

This release focuses on enabling the fix modes for various rules,
performing more testing of scenarios to prepare for the release.
Not finding anything major, but uncovering some "weird" combinations
that are causing unpredictable behavior.  That behavior is mostly
in the area of producing the correct Markdown from tokens to allow
the fix mode to produce reliable fixes.

## Version 0.9.17 - Date: 2024-02-05

This release focuses on getting the feature list complete
for a version 1.0 release in early 2024.  This release marked the
start of moving documentation from this repository to the more
curated [ReadTheDocs](https://pymarkdown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Some notable additions/changes are:

- taking a second pass at the outputs from the recent `fix` addition, re-verifying
  the output and fixing any issues
- cleaning up documentation to properly note what type of whitespace is used
  in the core and well as various extensions and plugins
    - at the same time, clearly followed the specification on what kind of whitespace
      to use, instead of allowing unicode whitespace by default
- for parsers like Python-Markdown, used in the MkDocs tools, added Rule Pml101
  to handle the different indentation requirements
    - note that this new rule give advice against Md007, so only one of the two
      rules should be enabled at any one time

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Added

- [Issue 975](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/975)
    - Added a new rule Pml101 to deal with "anchored list indents"
    - This adds support for `Python-Markdown` and other parsers like it
        - Used by tools such as `mkdocs` to build documentation sites
    - Defaults to an indent of 4 that starts from the beginning of the line or
      after a block quote start
    - Updated documentation for Md007 to mention Pml101 and when to use it
- [Issue 983](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/983)
    - Added base foundation for new documentation, publishing on
      read-the-docs.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->

    - second try, specifically missing github blob reference in urls
- [Issue 945](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/945)
    - inconsistent splitting of whitespace caused some issues
    - went through all strip() calls and ensured that they have the
      specific type of whitespace identified and documented
- [Issue 964](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/964)
    - final fix states needed verification and fixing of any issues
    - uncovered and fixed issues in Md007, Md019, and Md029
- [Issue 977](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/977)
    - fixed issue with md019 continuing to search for text blocks once the
      heading was completed
    - verified that Md021 does not have the same issue, but added tests to be sure
- [Issue 981](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/981)
    - added documentation for Rule Pml100
    - cleaned up mentions of whitespace in pragma and front matter extensions
- [Issue 986](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/986)
    - initial setting of log level to DEBUG with `--stack-trace` command line
      flag not working as expected
    - fixed to properly set log level to DEBUG for early application debugging

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Changed

- [Issue 966](https://github.com/jackdewinter/newsite.git)
    - adjusted fix for Md009 to remove any trailing whitespace if the line is within
      an Atx Heading

## Version 0.9.16 - Date: 2024-01-20

This release is going to focus on getting the feature list complete
for a version 1.0 release in early 2024.  To a large extent, this
involves adding the "fix" feature for some rules, and double checking
the output of many of the existing rules, looking for missing issues.

Some other notable additions/changes are:

- the `--continue-on-error` command line flag allows PyMarkdown to
  continue processing after any tokenization error or plugin error
    - while we hope this is not necessary long term, it is useful
- added `py.typed` file for any API users
    - this allows mypy to understand the typing included with the
      PyMarkdown API
- more parameterized tests
    - borrowing a pattern we have observed, transitioning scenario tests
      over to this new pattern
    - any plugin with the new Fix feature has parameterized tests

## Version 0.9.15 - Date: 2023-12-05

This release is mainly to fix issues related to technical debt. The PyMarkdown
project takes Markdown and generates a token stream to represent that Markdown.
To verify that the tokens are correct, HTML output is generated and matched
against reference implementations of the specification.  If those pass, the tests
then try to recreate the Markdown from the information in the tokens. So, to pass
a single test, the Markdown must generate tokens without any assertions, generate
the correct HTML, and be able to recreate the Markdown that it parsed.

The issues fixed include some issues that fixed assertions, caused improperly
formed HTML, and caused improperly formed Markdown. The majority of these issue
involved tab characters and containers.

## Version 0.9.14 - Date: 2023-10-31

This release is mostly to incorporate a number of small fixes and additions.
Behind the scenes, we spent a while looking at the roadmap and trying to figure
out the best path going forward.  Part of that was experimenting with different
forms of testing, to see how applicable they would be to this project.  That
work will be starting soon and be incremental.  It also pointed out a need for
better documentation, which will also be incremental going forward.

That experimentation lead to a couple of changes:

- Front matter is now interpretted as strict YAML, and not as some mashup of rules.
  This was decided on as it easier to explain and document.  This may cause some
  existing front-matter settings to not work as expected, especially validation
  of the front-matter itself and case-sensitivity on front-matter key fields.
- Added a new pragma command `disable-num-lines` to handle disabling rules for
  a given count of lines.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Added

- [Issue 776](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/776)
    - implement `disable-num-lines` pragma command
- [Issue 786](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/786)
    - added extension to disallow html, per GFM
    - added rule PML100 which detected the same thing, but does not fix

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Changed

- [Issue 750](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/750)
    - started work on making the tests more compact and efficient

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Fixed

- [Issue 774](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/774)
    - was following "weird" rules, changed to allow for standard YAML parser to
      determine validity
    - changed rule `md001` to look for case sensitive front-matter key name instead
      of case sensitive per switch to full YAML processing
- [Issue 791](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/791)
    - html blocks inside of 2+ levels of block quote was asserting
    - slight change to surrounding code to deal with less than case
- [Issue 793](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/793)
    - list block end with no paragraphs was causing an assert with MD027
    - double checked assert, is not needed and was just preventative

## Version 0.9.13.4 - Date: 2023-09-09

Note: noted there were some issues with the pymarkdown_test project and
giving false positives.  Will be looking into that for the next release.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading-->
### Fixed

- [Issue 755](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/pull/755)
    - fixed issue where new directories were not captured due to false positive
- [Issue 759](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/pull/759)
    - `code_blocks` property for MD010 was inverted
    - will check for others like this as more fix mode work is done

## Version 0.9.13 - Date: 2023-09-03

This release had some new features, but the most interesting one of all is
the start of the work on the `fix mode` that has been requested.  It is invoke
by invoking the scan engine with `-x-fix scan` instead of `scan`.  It is still
in the early stages, but you can experiment with it and rules md001, md009, md010,
and md047 for which fix mode has been implemented.  Note that all the documentation
will not reflect fix mode until it is further along, but try it out if you would
like!

In addition, because of requests, the following two features and one bug fix
have been addressed:

- YAML support
    - YAML support is provided for default configuration using the `.pymarkdown.yml`
      and `.pymarkdown.yaml` file
        - note that the `.pymarkdown` file is checked first, and if present, YAML
          default files will not be loaded
    - YAML support is provided for the command line `--config` argument
        - if the specified file does not parse as JSON, PyMarkdown will attempt
          to parse it as YAML
- Return Code Schemes
    - the `--return-code-scheme` argument accepts either `default` or `minimal`
    - `default` is the normaly return codes for PyMarkdown
    - `minimal` returns a code of 0 even if no files were found or if there were
      any rules triggered

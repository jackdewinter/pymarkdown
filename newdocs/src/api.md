# API Support

This document will enhance the existing API support.

While the vast majority of people using this application will use it through the
command line, there is an auto-generated
[API document](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/api.md)
and
[a companion document](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/api-usage.md)
on how to use the API. This support is very new, but introduced with lots of
testing. If there are usability issues or something you feel is missing, please
contact us.

## Version 0.9.8 - Date: 2022-09-20

This was a point release.  Issues that were addressed:

- cleared up issue with using proper path separators on Windows
- added and fixed tests for proper handling of whitespaces

NOTE for Windows users:

Prior to this release, when executing PyMarkdown against a file on a Windows
machine, any paths were reported using the Posix format.  This has been
corrected as of the 0.9.8 release, with Linux and MacOs reporting paths
in Posix format and Windows reporting paths in Windows format.  If you have
scripts that invoke PyMarkdown and interprets any returned paths, please
examine those scripts to see if they need to be changed.

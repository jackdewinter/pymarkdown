# Contributing

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to this library! We welcome any
type of pull request, issues and comments! ðŸ˜€

For pull requests, make sure you:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style (4 space indent)
* Run the `clean` script before submitting a Pull Request
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

If you are interested in working on something, there are usually features
and bugs in the [project backlog](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues)
that you can select from.  If you are not sure what to do or just want to help,
thius is generally the best thing to do.  If you are still undecided after that,
contact us, and we can have a conversation about how you can best contribute.

If you have something specific in mind, please thoroughly check the
[project backlog](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues)
and see if it is there, or if something like it is there.  If it is not there,
please [create an issue](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues),
explain the change you want to make, and include why you believe that change
is needed or is important.  Note that we generally will think about things like
new features for a while, just to make sure that they feel right for the project.
